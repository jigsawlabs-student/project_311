# 1. nice job migrating to the manage.py, settings.py structure
# 2. You have some functions defined that are not used anywhere, a couple functions that do not look like they work.
# I pointed these out in the codebase
# I think your code would benefit from adding another API eventually, or building on your frontend
# It might be near the time to add an agencies class and related database

# add tests :)

# Overall, it's a good start and you have the framework down, but still more work to be done.
